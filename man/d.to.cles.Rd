\title{Conversion from Cohen's d to Common Language Effect Size}
\usage{
d.to.cles(d, design = c("independent", "paired", "one.sample"), verbose = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Cohen's d}

\item{design}{character; one of the "independent", "paired", or
"one.sample". The default is "independent".}

\item{verbose}{\code{1} by default (returns test, hypotheses, and results),
if \code{2} a more detailed output is given (plus key
parameters and defintions), if \code{0} no output is printed
on the console.}

\value{
\item{d}{Cohen's d}

}
\description{
Helper function to convert Cohen's d to common language effect size (or vice
versa). The result is the probability of superiority for independent
samples. It can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly selected
observation from Group 1 exceeds a randomly selected observation from Group
2. The rationale is the same for paired-samples and one-sample designs, but
the interpretation differs: For paired samples, it can be interpreted as the
probability that the difference score (i.e., the score under Condition 1
minus the score under Condition 2) is greater than zero for a randomly
selected individual. For a one-sample design, it can be interpreted as the
probability that a randomly selected observation is greater than the
reference value (e.g., 0).
