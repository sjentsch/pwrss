# Helper function to converts marginal probabilities to joint probabilities for the McNemar test applied to paired binary data.

Helper function to converts marginal probabilities to joint
probabilities for the McNemar test applied to paired binary data.

## Usage

``` r
marginal.probs.2x2(prob11, prob10, prob01, prob00, verbose = 1)
```

## Arguments

- prob11:

  (joint) probability of success in both groups. 'prob11' and 'prob00'
  are known as concordant probs.

- prob10:

  (joint) probability of success in case (or after) but failure in
  matched control (or before). 'prob10' and 'prob01' are known as
  discordant probs.

- prob01:

  (joint) probability of failure in case (or after) but success in
  matched control (or before). prob10' and 'prob01' are known as
  discordant probs.

- prob00:

  (joint) probability of failure in both groups. 'prob11' and 'prob00'
  are known as concordant probs.

- verbose:

  `1` by default (returns test, hypotheses, and results), if `2` a more
  detailed output is given (plus key parameters and defintions), if `0`
  no output is printed on the console.

## Value

- parms:

  list of parameters used in calculation.

- prob1:

  (marginal) probability of success in case group (or after).

- prob2:

  (marginal) probability of success in matched-control group (or
  before).

- rho:

  the correlation between case and matched-control, or after and before
  (phi coefficient).
